# Birthday Eevee

A Discord bot for storing birthdays, and announces when the date matches.<br/>
Written specifically for a friend's Discord server.

Also used as an exercise to familiarise myself with the Python programming language.

### [main.py](/main.py)
The file that stores all of the commands and interactions.

### [birthday.py](/birthday.py)
The file that stores all the code that is used to read/write data.

### Version 1.0

The bot also comes with an echo function, and a moderator-induced emoji reacting.
